TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working within the Machine Intelligence team at Google Brain to conduct research in machine learning and neural networks. However, the framework is versatile enough to be used in other areas as well.

TensorFlow provides stable Python and C++ APIs, as well as a non-guaranteed backward compatible API for other languages.
